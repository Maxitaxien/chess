Board

Winning
The game is won by checkmate. Checkmate is defined as the king being in check with no possible ways to
escape checking, meaning the king is unable to move to a safe square, the piece delivering check cannot be captured,
and the attack of the piece delivering the check cannot be blocked by another piece.

Drawing
The game is drawn by stalemate, which is when a player has no legal moves.
As of now, there are no plans to incorporate the 50-move rule and draws by three-fold repetition.
