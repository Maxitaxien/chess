Hey, thanks for checking this out! As of now this is pretty bare-bones, but I hope to be able to develop it further in the future.
My own love of chess inspired me to try this project. I don't know where it'll go - maybe I'll just settle for making a functional chessboard.
Hopefully the functioning chess board can be a basis for further projects as well!

Feel free to copy code (it doesn't really do much yet anyway).
