This is the start of a project to try and make chess from scratch on my own in python!
As of now this is pretty bare-bones, but I hope to be able to develop it further in the future.
My own love of chess inspired me to try this project. I don't know where it'll go - maybe I'll just settle for making a functional chessboard.
