This is the start of a project to try and make chess from scratch on my own in python!

Current status: Movement and capture of all pieces should work correctly. Special rules like castling and en passant are not implemented, pawn promotion is not implemented and check/checkmate rules are not implemented.

File explanations:
The file pieces.py has all the piece classes with their associated methods.

The file board.py contains the Board classes with its main attribute Board.board which has a board representation. This file also has the logic for updating the board and checking for legal moves.

The file main.py contains the setup of the board and the main game loop.
