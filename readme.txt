This is the start of a project to try and make chess from scratch on my own in python!
As of now this is pretty bare-bones, but I hope to be able to develop it further in the future.
My own love of chess inspired me to try this project. I don't know where it'll go - maybe I'll just settle for making a functional chessboard.

File explanations:
The file pieces.py has all the piece classes with their associated methods.

The file board.py contains the Board classes with its main attribute Board.board which has a board representation. This
file also has the logic for updating the board and checking for legal moves.

The file main.py contains the setup of the board and the main game loop.
