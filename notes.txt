Might have to at every point calculate every legal move anyway, as the current solution does not account for discovered checks...

Make sure to implement logic to deal with when multiple of the same piece can move to the same square.

Pseudocode for making other moves illegal when in check:

if check:
    save checking_move
    for each possible moves:
        if checking_move is still possible, continue
        else, checkmate
    if possible move exists, ask for move:
        if checking_move still legal after given_move:
            given_move is illegal
        else:
            given_move is played


Pseudocode for stalemate:
if check == false and for all pieces: piece.legal_moves == []:
    result = stalemate
